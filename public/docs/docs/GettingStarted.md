# Getting Started
Here are some simple steps to begin programming in Sea!<br>
- Clone this Repository. You can delete everything except the `/Shore` directory if you'd like.
- Create a file ending in `.sea`.
- Write your program in that file. You can follow the [Sea Reference](/#/docs/reference) to learn more about this.
- Follow the [Compilation Guide](/#/docs/runners/usage) to run your program!
You can also try splitting up your program into multiple files within a single directory if you'd like!
