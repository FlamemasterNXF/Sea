# The List Types
The List Types can be used to store multiple values of a certain Type in one place.<br>
There is no Void List Type.

## Declaration 
You can declare a variable of any List Type by using the `<type><> <name> = [<value>, <value>, ... <value>]` syntax.

## Access 
You can access a value at a given Index of a List by using the `<name>[<number>]` syntax.

## Notes
List values are mutable.<br>
If you'd like to have a List with immutable values you should use [The Array Types](Arrays.md).
