# The Void Type
The Void Type is a special type only used as a return Type in a Function declaration.

## Declaration 
You can declare a Function with the Void return Type by using the `function void <name>(){ ... }` syntax. The Void Type cannot be used in a Variable declaration.

## Notes
Any Function declared with the Void Type may not use a return statement followed by a value.
