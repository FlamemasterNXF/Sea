# SR
## Explanation 
SR is short for Shore Runner.<br>
It contains the Shore REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) and the program to run the REPL.<br>
## Usage
SR can be easily utilized by running [`sr.cmd`](../sr.cmd) in your console of choice.<br>
This will allow you to use the Shore REPL to quickly write and test Sea programs.<br>
## REPL Hotkeys
- You can return to a previously used REPL script by pressing `PgUp` on your keyboard.<br>
- You can delete your current REPL script by pressing `Esc` on your keyboard.<br>
- You can exit the REPL by pressing `F2` on your keyboard.<br>
- You can navigate your current REPL script using the arrow keys.<br>
## REPL Commands
- You can use `#showTree` to toggle if the REPL outputs Parse Trees. Parse Tree outputs are disabled by default.<br>
- You can use `#showProgram` to toggle if the REPL outputs Bound Trees. Bound Tree outputs are disabled by default.<br>
- You can use `#cls` to clear the console.<br>
- You can use `#reset` to reset the REPL. This deletes all Function and Variable declarations.<br>
