# Sea
Welcome to Sea!<br>
Sea is a homemade compiled programming language made in C#.<br>

## Dependencies
Sea should be able to run just fine as long as you have .NET7 or .NET6* installed. Sea will not work with older versions of .NET.<br>
\* If you'd like to use .NET6 you must change the all `--framework` values in the [Build File](./Shore/build.cmd), the [SR File](./Shore/sr.cmd), and the [SC File](./Shore/sc.cmd) to `net6.0`

## Documentation 
This repository contains [documentation](./Docs/Reference.md) for all the features of Sea.<br>
You can follow the [Getting Started Guide](./Docs/GettingStarted.md) if you don't know where to start!<br>

## Contribution 
I will accept Pull Requests purely based on my own discretion. I may deny Pull Requests implementing features I'd like to make myself. I appreciate all contributions to my projects, but I'd also like to continue making Sea based off own my ideas and plans.<br>
Please use [Conventinal Commit Naming](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when making Pull Requests. Be sure to mark which part of the program you're contributing to in the commit name! (`chore(documentation): ... `, `feat(binder): ... `, etc)

## Join the Community
If you'd like to have the ability to have longer conversations about Sea with me than Issues and Pull Requests allow, join the [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/dauxGZwc9u).<br>

## Thanks and Love
Thank you to everyone who helped me make [PeanutScript](https://github.com/FlamemasterNXF/PeanutScript), my first programming language. Your help and suggestions led to me making Sea, which is a far better language than PeanutScript ever was.<br>
