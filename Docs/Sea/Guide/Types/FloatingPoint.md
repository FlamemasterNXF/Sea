# Floating Point Number Types
The Floating Point Number Types are a group of Types which represent Floating Point numbers. All Floating Point Number Types support arithmetic and comparison operators.<br>

## A Forewarning...
Sadly, I have had some technical difficulties implementing Floating Point Number Types. Currently only the `int` type is supported.<br>
Support for `double` is planed for Sea 2.<br>

## Declaration
You can declare a variable of any of the Integral Number Types by using the `<type> <name> = <value>` syntax.

## Characteristics of each type
- `float`: Stores a value from ±1.5 x 10−45 to ±3.4 x 1038
- `double`: Stores a value from ±5.0 × 10−324 to ±1.7 × 10308
