# Integral Number Types
The Integral Number Types are a group of Types which represent integer numbers. All Integral Types support arithmetic and comparison operators.<br>

## A Forewarning...
Sadly, I have had some technical difficulties implementing Integral Types. Currently only the `int` type is supported.<br>
Support for `byte`, `short`, and `long` are planed for Sea 2.<br>

## Declaration
You can declare a variable of any of the Integral Number Types by using the `<type> <name> = <integer value>` syntax.

## Characteristics of each type
- `byte`: Stores an integer from -128 to 127.
- `short`: Stores an integer from -32,768 to 32767.
- `int`: Stores an integer from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Bitwise operators can be used on `int`.
- `long`: Stores and integer from 	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
