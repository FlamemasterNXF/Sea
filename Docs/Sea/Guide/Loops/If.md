# If Statements
While not truly a loop, If Statements fix in nicely with the other loops.

## Usage
If Statements are simple loops which only run if a certain condition is evaluated to true. They can also have else statements attached that are ran if that same condition is evaluated to false.

## Declaration
If Statements can be declared with the `if (<condition>) { ... } <else syntax?>` syntax.

## Else Statements
Else Statements are attached to a certain If Statement and are only ran if that Statement evaluates its condition to false. They can be declared with the `else { ... }` syntax.
