# For Loops
For Loops are a simplified version of a common use for While Loops.<br>

## Usage
For Loops are a nice shortcut for common While Loops. Simply declare a For Loop with a base value for an int `i` and an upper bound for `i` and it will run until `i` reaches that limit. `i` is automatically incremented by one each time the loop is ran.<br>

## Declaration
For Loops can be declared with the `for i = <value> until <limit> { ... }` syntax.<br>
Note that though it is typical to declare a For Loop with an integer `i`, `i` can be named whatever you wish.<br>
