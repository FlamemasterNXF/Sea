# Future Plans
Curious about the future of Sea? Here's a small dump of all of my future plans.<br>

## Big Ideas
- Classes ( + inheritance )
- using Statements
- Constants
- Comments
- Arrays
- Lists
- Dictionaries 
- Explicit Access Modifiers
- More... probably :)

## QoL
- Remove the `function` keyword
- Remove the need to use the console to run SC
- More... definitely :)

## The Technical Side
- Emitting IL
- Add a system for storing whitespaces (and comments, when they're added) in the Node Tree
- Possibly add a system to map Nodes to Bound Nodes
- More... but you'll be bored :)
